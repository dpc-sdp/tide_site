# INTRODUCTION
The Tide Site module provides the functionality to post to multiple sites and sections from
 a single content server.

# REQUIREMENTS
* [Tide Core](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/tide_core)

# RECOMMENDED MODULES
* [Tide API](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/tide_api)
* [Tide Media](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/tide_media)

# INSTALLATION
Include the Tide Site module in your composer.json file

```bash
composer require dpc-sdp/tide_site
```

# Caveats

Tide Site is on the alpha release, use with caution. APIs are likely to change before the stable version, that there will be breaking changes and that we're not supporting it for external production sites at the moment.
